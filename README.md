# PromLink: Prometheus Alert Integration for Mattermost and RocketChat

## Overview

**PromLink** is a seamless integration tool that connects Prometheus Alertmanager with Mattermost and RocketChat channels, enabling organizations to receive real-time alerts directly in their internal communication platforms.

## Problem Statement

Organizations using Mattermost and RocketChat for internal communication often face challenges in receiving direct alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager. The lack of a straightforward integration mechanism hampers timely responses to critical events.

## Solution

PromLink provides a direct integration between Prometheus Alertmanager and Mattermost/RocketChat, allowing alerts to flow seamlessly into designated channels. This integration ensures that teams can quickly respond to alerts and maintain robust communication during incidents.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. Key features include:

- **Time-Series Data**: Efficiently stores and queries metrics over time.
- **PromQL**: A powerful query language for flexible data retrieval.
- **Flexible Collection**: Uses a pull model to collect metrics from configured targets.
- **Built-In Alerting**: Integrates with various notification systems to handle alerts.

## What is Prometheus Alertmanager?

Prometheus Alertmanager is responsible for managing alerts generated by Prometheus. It offers:

- **Alert Management**: Handles alerts from Prometheus and client applications.
- **Flexible Routing**: Routes alerts based on custom labels.
- **Silencing & Inhibition**: Suppresses unnecessary alerts to prevent alert storms.
- **Notification Integrations**: Supports integrations with email, Slack, PagerDuty, and more.
- **Grouping**: Clusters related alerts to reduce notification fatigue.

## What are Mattermost and RocketChat?

Mattermost and RocketChat are open-source messaging platforms tailored for team collaboration. They provide:

- **Real-Time Communication**: Facilitate instant messaging and discussions.
- **Customization**: Highly flexible with plugins and integrations.
- **Deployment Options**: Available as self-hosted or cloud-based solutions.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Seamlessly connect with various tools for streamlined workflows.

## Key Insights and System Integration

During the development of PromLink, several key insights were gained:

- **Architecture Clarification**: Initially, there was a misconception that Alertmanager was part of Prometheus's core. It operates as a separate, autonomous component, necessitating a different integration approach.
- **Community Support**: We leveraged community support to overcome compilation challenges and enhance the robustness of our integration.
