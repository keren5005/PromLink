# PromLink:  Prometheus Alert Integration for Mattermost and RocketChat

## Overview

**PromLink** is a seamless integration tool that connects Prometheus Alertmanager with Mattermost and RocketChat channels, enabling organizations to receive real-time alerts directly in their internal communication platforms. Organizations using Mattermost and RocketChat for internal communication often face challenges in receiving direct alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager. The lack of a straightforward integration mechanism hampers timely responses to critical events. PromLink provides a direct integration between Prometheus Alertmanager and Mattermost/RocketChat, allowing alerts to flow seamlessly into designated channels. This integration ensures that teams can quickly respond to alerts and maintain robust communication during incidents.
